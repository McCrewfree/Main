# NYU Metropolitan Mobile Bandwidth Trace 

## Summary
NYU Metropolitan Mobile Bandwidth Trace, a.k.a. NYU-METS, is a LTE mobile bandwidth dataset that were measured in New York City metropolitian area. It covers several transportation scenarios like Subway, Bus, Ferry etc.

## Description 

We collected long bandwidth traces in New York City Metropolitan area. These traces are collected in Bus, Subway, Ferry and Rail Road etc. 

Bus:   
Bus B57 (Between IKEA Brooklyn and Flushing Ave & 61 st Street)   
B62 (Between MetroTech and Queensboro Plaza)  
NYU Campus Bus Route A (Between Downtown Brooklyn and NYU Bookstore)  

Subway:   
Subway 7 Train (Between Queensboro Plaza and Flushing Main Street)  
Subway Q Train (Between Prospect Park and Coney Island)  
Subway D Train (Between Prospect Ave and Stillwell Avenue)   

Ferry:  
Ferry (Between South Ferry and Staten Island)  

Car:   
Car (Between Downtown Brooklyn and LGA)

Long Island Rail Road:  
Long Island Rail Road (Between Woodside Station and Little Neck).

For each experiment, we connect a LTE mobile phone to a remote server in our lab at NYU. 
We run iPerf and record TCP throughput every 1,000 millisecond for a long and successive time in the same scenario. All the bandwidth samples are logged on the server side. 

We are continuing this measurement campaign and keep adding new traces to our NYU-METS Dataset for future research.
